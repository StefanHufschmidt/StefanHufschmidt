- 👋 Hi, I’m Stefan Decker (@StefanHufschmidt)
- 👀 I’m interested in finding solutions for complex problems and to kuddle my bernaise mountain dog.
- :computer: I'm a full-stack developer and dev-op, mainly building microservices with Kotlin, Spring-Boot and React running inside Docker containers on k8s clusters.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about Coroutines, LocalThreads and project Loom.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things which help me to solve complex problems even faster or in a better way.
- 📫 You can contact me on LinkedIn.
